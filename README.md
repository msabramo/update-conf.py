update-conf.py
==============

Generate config files from `conf.d` like directories.

Split your config file into smaller files in a `conf.d` like directory. The generated config file will be the concatenation of all splitted config files. The spplited files will be merged in the lexical sort order of their names. 

Files ending with `.bak`, `.old` and other similar terminations will be ignored.

This project was based in the [update-conf.d project](https://github.com/Atha/update-conf.d).

Install
-------

At first, we need Python 2.6 or newer. It's possible to use Python 3 too.

In Ubuntu/Debian:

```sh
apt-get install python
```

After, install the requirements:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At last, install the script:

```sh
make install
```

Usage
-----

If can run:

```sh
update-conf.py -f /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
```

The script will merge the splitted config files in the directory `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.d` in the file `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`.

If the directory containing the splitted files uses a diferent name pattern, you can pass its name as an param:

```sh
update-conf.py -f /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf -d /etc/snmp/snmpd.d
```

It's also possible to define the paths in a config file (`/etc/update-conf.py.conf`):

```ini
[snmpd]
file = /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
dir = /etc/snmp/snmpd.d
```

Now, you can run:

```sh
update-conf.py -n snmpd
```

To get help:

```sh
update-conf.py --help
```

- Comments in the generated file, depending of the config file type:

  ```
  # Auto-generated by update-conf.py
  ```

  or

  ```
  ; Auto-generated by update-conf.py
  ```

- Verbosity (`-v` or `--verbose`).
